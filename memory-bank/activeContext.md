# Active Context for Top Tools Project

## Current Work Focus

- **Memory Bank Maintenance**: Completed comprehensive review and update of all memory bank files on 7/9/2025 per
  continuous improvement protocol.
- **Tool Curation**: Actively expanding documentation for new developer productivity tools in the `src/` directory.
- **Context Window Management**: Monitoring context window usage (currently at 19%) to maintain efficient task
  execution.

## Recent Changes

- Updated `progress.md` on 7/9/2025 to document recent developments and new tool additions.
- Added new entry to `raw_reflection_log.md` on 7/9/2025 capturing insights from memory bank maintenance.
- Updated `activeContext.md` on 7/9/2025 to reflect current project status and priorities.
- Modified logging setup in `xkcd_scraper.py` on 7/1/2025 to avoid writing logs to a file, ensuring cleaner project
  directory structure.
- Updated `consolidated_learnings.md` on 7/8/2025 to consolidate recent reflections.

## Next Steps

- **Priority**: Focus on tool curation - identify and document 3 new productivity tools by end of week.
- **Secondary**: Prepare for community engagement initiative by drafting contribution guidelines.
- **Maintenance**: Schedule next memory bank review for August 1, 2025.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Decision to implement quarterly memory bank maintenance cycles to ensure documentation freshness.
- Decision to prioritize tool curation over XKCD Scraper enhancements for immediate roadmap.
- Decision to maintain context window usage below 30% during active development phases.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- User preference for Markdown documentation consistency across all project files.
- Adherence to Baby Steps™ methodology for all maintenance tasks.
- Preference for concise, actionable documentation over verbose explanations.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Regular memory bank audits significantly improve context preservation across sessions.
- Auto-formatting behavior in VSCode requires special consideration during SEARCH/REPLACE operations.
- Cross-file synchronization (progress.md ↔ activeContext.md) is essential for documentation consistency.
- Maintaining context window usage below 30% improves task execution efficiency.
