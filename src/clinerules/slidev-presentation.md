# Slidev Project Instructions

This document provides guidelines for working with Slidev projects. Slidev is a Markdown-based presentation tool powered
by Vue and Vite.

## Core Concepts & Structure

1. **Entry Point**: The main presentation content is typically in `http://slides.md`.
2. **Slide Separation**: Slides are separated by `---` on a new line.
3. **Frontmatter/Headmatter**:

- YAML blocks at the beginning of the file (`--- ... ---`) configure the deck (headmatter) or individual slides
  (frontmatter).
- Headmatter (first block) applies globally (e.g., `theme`, `title`, `addons`).
- Frontmatter configures specific slides (e.g., `layout`, `background`, `class`, `transition`, `clicks`).
- **YAML Quoting:** Prefer double quotes (`"..."`) for strings containing single quotes (`'`) to avoid parsing errors
  (e.g., `title: "My Deck's Title"`).

4. **Layouts**:

- Define the structure of slides. Specified via `layout:` in frontmatter.
- Default layout for the first slide is `cover`, others are `default`.
- Custom layouts are placed in the `layouts/` directory as `.vue` files. Use `<slot />` for default content and named
  slots (`<slot name="xxx" />`) for specific sections.

5. **Components**:

- Vue components can be used directly in Markdown (e.g., `<MyComponent />`).
- Components are auto-imported from:
- Slidev built-ins (`@slidev/client/builtin/`).
- The active theme.
- Installed addons.
- The local `components/` directory.
- Custom components go in the `components/` directory as `.vue` files.

6. **Styles**:

- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev) is built-in for utility-first styling. Apply classes directly in Markdown or components.
- Global styles can be added in the `styles/` directory (e.g., `styles/index.css`).
- Scoped styles for a specific slide can be added using `<style scoped>...</style>` within the slide's Markdown.

7. **Assets**:

- Static assets (images, videos) can be placed in the `public/` directory and referenced with absolute paths starting
  with `/` (e.g., `background: /my-image.png`).
- Relative paths (e.g., `./image.png`) work for standard Markdown image syntax (`![alt](./image.png)`) but might break
  in frontmatter or components after building. Prefer the `public/` directory method for reliability.

8. **Notes**:

- Presenter notes are added as HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) at the _very end_ of a slide's Markdown content.
- Notes support Markdown formatting.

## Key Features & Syntax

1. **Code Blocks**:

- Use standard Markdown fenced code blocks (e.g., ` ```ts ... ``` `).
- Syntax highlighting is provided by Shiki.
- Supports line highlighting (`{1,3-5}`), line numbers (`{lines:true}`), Monaco editor (`{monaco}`), diffs
  (`{monaco-diff}`), code imports (`<<< @/path/to/file.js#region {lines=...}`). Refer to the Syntax Guide for details.

2. **Animations (Clicks)**:

- Use `<v-click>` component or `v-click` directive to reveal elements step-by-step.
- `v-after` reveals elements simultaneously with the previous `v-click`.
- `.hide` modifier (e.g., `v-click.hide`) hides elements instead of showing them.
- `<v-clicks>` component applies `v-click` to its children (useful for lists).
- Control timing with `at="..."` (e.g., `v-click="3"` for absolute click 3, `v-click="'+2'"` for 2 clicks after the
  previous relative element).
- Specify enter/leave ranges: `v-click="[2, 5]"` (visible from click 2 up to, but not including, 5).
- Override total clicks per slide with `clicks: N` in frontmatter.

3. **Motion (VueUse Motion)**:

- Use the `v-motion` directive for element transitions (e.g., `:initial="{ x: -80 }" :enter="{ x: 0 }"`).
- Can be triggered by clicks using `:click-N` attributes (e.g., `:click-1="{ y: 30 }"`).

4. **Slide Transitions**:

- Set in headmatter (`transition: slide-left`) for global effect or frontmatter for specific slides.
- Built-in transitions: `fade`, `fade-out`, `slide-left`, `slide-right`, `slide-up`, `slide-down`, `view-transition`.
- Specify different forward/backward transitions: `transition: slide-left | slide-right`.

5. **Diagrams**: Supports Mermaid (` ```mermaid ... ``` `) and PlantUML (` ```plantuml ... ``` `).
6. **LaTeX**: Use `$` for inline math (`$a^2+b^2=c^2$`) and `$$` for block math.
7. **Global Context**: Access runtime info like `$nav` (navigation controls), `$clicks` (current click count), `$page`
   (current slide number), `$frontmatter`, `$slidev.configs` within components or directly in Markdown using `{{ }}`.
   Use composables like `useNav()` from `@slidev/client` in `<script setup>`.

## Development Workflow

1. **Initialization (Full Project)**: Use `pnpm create slidev <project-name>` (or npm/yarn/bun equivalent).
2. **Development Server (Full Project)**: Run `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`, etc.) in the project directory. Access at
   `http://localhost:3030`.
3. **Development Server (Single File)**: Navigate to the directory containing your `slides.md` and run
   `npx @slidev/cli`. This is useful for quick previews without a full project setup.
   - **Note:** Ensure you use the correct package name: `@slidev/cli`.
   - **Theme Installation:** If a theme specified in the frontmatter (e.g., `theme: seriph`) isn't installed, Slidev
     will prompt you to install it. Confirm by pressing 'y' and choosing your package manager (e.g., 'npm').
4. **Editing**: Modify `slides.md` and add custom components/layouts/styles as needed.
5. **Exporting**:

- Install `playwright-chromium` (`pnpm add -D playwright-chromium`).
- Run `pnpm export` (or `npm run export`, etc.) to generate a PDF (`slides-export.pdf` by default).
- Use `--format png` or `--format pptx`.
- Use `--with-clicks` to export each click step as a separate page/image.
- Use `--output <filename>` to specify the output file.
- Use `--dark` for dark mode export.

5. **Building for Hosting**:

- Run `pnpm build` (or `npm run build`, etc.) to create a static SPA in the `dist/` folder.
- Use `--base /path/` if deploying to a subpath.
- Deploy the `dist` folder to static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages). Configuration files (`netlify.toml`,
  `vercel.json`, GitHub Actions workflow) are often included in the starter template.

## Best Practices

- Keep `http://slides.md` focused on content.
- Use layouts for consistent slide structure.
- Use components for reusable UI elements and interactivity.
- Leverage themes and addons for styling and features before building custom solutions.
- Use the `public/` directory for static assets referenced in frontmatter or components.
- Utilize presenter mode (`/presenter` route or button) for notes and controls during presentation.
- Pay attention to terminal output for errors (e.g., YAML parsing issues) when starting the server.
