# Cline for Research Assistant

**Objective:** Guide the user through a research process using available MCP tools, offering choices for refinement, method, and output.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initiation:** This rule activates automatically when it is toggled "on" and the user asks a question that appears to be a research request. It then takes the user's initial question as the starting `research_topic`.
2.  **Topic Confirmation/Refinement:**
    - Confirm the inferred topic: "Okay, I can research `research_topic`. Would you like to refine this query first?"
    - Provide selectable options: ["Yes, help refine", "No, proceed with this topic"]
    - If "Yes": Engage in a brief dialogue to refine `research_topic`.
    - If "No": Proceed.
3.  **Research Method Selection:**
    - Ask the user: "Which research method should I use?"
    - Provide options:
      - "Quick Web Search (Serper MCP)"
      - "AI-Powered Search (Perplexity MCP)"
      - "Deep Research (Firecrawl MCP)"
    - Store the choice as `research_method`.
4.  **Output Format Selection:**
    - Ask the user: "How should I deliver the results?"
    - Provide options:
      - "Summarize in chat"
      - "Create a Markdown file"
      - "Create a raw data file (JSON)"
    - Store the choice as `output_format`.
    - If a file format is chosen, ask: "What filename should I use? (e.g., `topic_results.md` or `topic_data.json`)" Store as `output_filename`. Default to `research_results.md` or `research_data.json` if no name is provided.
5.  **Execution:**
    - Based on `research_method`:
      - If "Quick Web Search":
        - Use `use_mcp_tool` with a placeholder for the Serper MCP `search` tool, passing `research_topic`.
        - Inform the user: "Executing Quick Web Search via Serper MCP..."
      - If "AI-Powered Search":
        - Use `use_mcp_tool` for `github.com/pashpashpash/perplexity-mcp` -> `search` tool, passing `research_topic`.
        - Inform the user: "Executing AI-Powered Search via Perplexity MCP..."
      - If "Deep Research":
        - Use `use_mcp_tool` for `github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp-server` -> `firecrawl_deep_research` tool, passing `research_topic`.
        - Inform the user: "Executing Deep Research via Firecrawl MCP... (This may take a few minutes)"
    - Store the raw result as `raw_research_data`.
6.  **Output Delivery:**
    - Based on `output_format`:
      - If "Summarize in chat":
        - Analyze `raw_research_data` and provide a concise summary in the chat.
      - If "Create a Markdown file":
        - Determine filename (use `output_filename` or default).
        - Format `raw_research_data` into Markdown and use `write_to_file` to save it.
        - Inform the user: "Research results saved to `<filename>`."
      - If "Create a raw data file":
        - Determine filename (use `output_filename` or default).
        - Use `write_to_file` to save `raw_research_data` (likely JSON).
        - Inform the user: "Raw research data saved to `<filename>`."
7.  **Completion:** End the rule execution.

**Notes:**

- This rule relies on the user having the Perplexity Firecrawl, and Serper MCP servers connected and running.
- The "Quick Web Search" option is currently hypothetical and would require a Serper MCP server to be implemented and connected.
- Error handling (e.g., if an MCP tool fails) is omitted for brevity but should be considered for a production rule.
