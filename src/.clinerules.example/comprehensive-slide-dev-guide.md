# Comprehensive Slidev Guide: Crafting High-Quality Advanced Presentations

This guide provides a dense overview of Slidev's capabilities, focusing on advanced techniques and best practices for creating visually stunning and highly interactive presentations. It assumes a basic understanding of Markdown and Vue.js.

## 1. Core Structure and Advanced Syntax

Slidev presentations are built upon Markdown files, enhanced with YAML frontmatter for configuration and Vue components for dynamic content.

### Slide Separation and Frontmatter

Separate slides with `---`. The first `---` block is the headmatter (global config), subsequent blocks are slide-specific frontmatter.

```yaml
---
theme: seriph # Global theme
title: Advanced Slidev Techniques
canvasWidth: 1200 # Custom canvas width
aspectRatio: 16/9 # Widescreen aspect ratio
fonts:
  sans: Roboto
  mono: 'Fira Code, monospace'
  provider: google # Use Google Fonts
---
# Welcome Slide

<!-- This is a presenter note -->

---
layout: cover # Use the cover layout
background: /images/background.png # Slide background image
class: text-white # Apply UnoCSS classes
---
# Section Title

::right::
Content for the right slot

---
src: ./sections/advanced-animations.md # Import slides from another file
---
```

**Advanced Frontmatter Options:**

- `clicks`: Manually set the total number of clicks for a slide.
- `routeAlias`: Define a custom route name for a slide for easier navigation (`<Link to="my-alias">`).
- `hideInToc`: Exclude a slide from the Table of Contents.
- `download`: Include a download button for the PDF export in the built SPA. Can be boolean (`true`) or a custom URL string.
- `monacoTypesAdditionalPackages`: Array of strings to specify extra packages for Monaco Editor type acquisition.
- `monacoTypesSource: ata`: Enable client-side auto type acquisition for Monaco.
- `drawings.persist`: Boolean (`true`/`false`) or `'dev'` to control drawing persistence.
- `transition`: Define per-slide transitions (`fade`, `slide-left`, `view-transition`, custom CSS transitions). Use `|` for forward/backward transitions (`slide-left | slide-right`). Can also be an object for advanced Vue Transition options.
- `title`: Set the title for a slide, overriding the title extracted from the first heading.
- `level`: Set the title level for a slide, affecting its appearance in the Table of Contents.
- `class`: Add custom CSS classes to the slide container.
- `style`: Add inline CSS styles to the slide container.
- `id`: Set a custom ID for the slide container.
- `name`: Set a custom name for the slide, usable with `<Link to="name">`.
- `plantUmlServer`: Configure a custom PlantUML server URL.
- `htmlAttrs`: Add attributes to the `<html>` tag for a specific slide.
- `bodyAttrs`: Add attributes to the `<body>` tag for a specific slide.
- `head`: Add custom tags to the `<head>` section for a specific slide (array of objects).
- `vue`: Configure Vue plugin options for a specific slide.
- `markdown`: Configure Markdown-it options for a specific slide.
- `highlighter`: Configure Shiki highlighter options for a specific slide.
- `katex`: Configure KaTeX options for a specific slide.
- `monaco`: Configure Monaco Editor options for a specific slide.
- `shortcuts`: Configure keyboard shortcuts for a specific slide.
- `transformers`: Configure markdown transformers for a specific slide.
- `codeRunners`: Configure code runners for a specific slide.
- `clicks`: Manually set the total number of clicks for a slide.
- `routeAlias`: Define a custom route name for a slide for easier navigation (`<Link to="my-alias">`).
- `hideInToc`: Exclude a slide from the Table of Contents.
- `download`: Include a download button for the PDF export in the built SPA. Can be boolean or a custom URL.
- `monacoTypesAdditionalPackages`: Specify extra packages for Monaco Editor type acquisition.
- `monacoTypesSource: ata`: Enable client-side auto type acquisition for Monaco.
- `drawings.persist: true`: Save drawings as SVGs. Can also be set to `false` or `dev` to disable.
- `plantUmlServer`: Configure a custom PlantUML server URL.
- `htmlAttrs`: Add attributes to the `<html>` tag for a specific slide.
- `bodyAttrs`: Add attributes to the `<body>` tag for a specific slide.
- `head`: Add custom tags to the `<head>` section for a specific slide.

### Notes and Click Markers

Add presenter notes using HTML comments `<!-- ... -->` at the end of a slide. Use `[click]` markers within notes to synchronize notes with click animations. `[click:N]` skips N-1 clicks.

```markdown
<!--
Introduction to the topic

[click] First key point

[click:3] Third key point, skipping the second click

[click:+2] Another point, 2 clicks after the previous marker
-->
```

**Advanced Click Markers:**

- Use `[click]` at the beginning of a line in notes to synchronize with the next click animation on the slide.
- Use `[click:N]` to synchronize with a specific absolute click number N.
- Use `[click:+N]` to synchronize N clicks after the previous click marker.
- Content between click markers is highlighted in the presenter notes.
- Click markers help in navigating notes during the presentation, especially with the presenter mode.

### Importing Slides

Organize large presentations by splitting content into multiple Markdown files and importing them using the `src` frontmatter option.

```yaml
---
src: ./chapters/chapter1.md # Import entire file
---

---
src: ./appendix.md#2-5,8 # Import specific slides (2, 3, 4, 5, and 8)
---
```

Frontmatter from the main entry has higher priority during merging. This allows overriding configurations from imported files.

## 2. Mastering Visuals and Styling

Create visually appealing slides using themes, custom styles, fonts, and assets.

### Themes and Customization

Apply a theme via the `theme` headmatter option. Explore the [Theme Gallery](https://sli.dev/resources/theme-gallery). Eject a theme (`slidev theme eject`) for deep customization.

**Writing Themes:** Themes are npm packages (`slidev-theme-*`) that can provide styles, layouts, components, and default configurations (`package.json` `slidev.defaults`). Themes should focus on appearance.

### Styling with UnoCSS

Slidev integrates UnoCSS for utility-first styling. Apply classes directly in Markdown or components.

```html
<div class="text-center text-primary font-bold">Centered Bold Primary Text</div>
```

**Customizing UnoCSS:** Create `uno.config.ts` in your project root to extend configurations, add shortcuts, custom rules, variants, etc.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'unocss'
export default defineConfig({
  shortcuts: {
    btn: 'px-4 py-2 rounded inline-block bg-teal-600 text-white cursor-pointer hover:bg-teal-700 disabled:cursor-default disabled:bg-gray-600 disabled:opacity-50',
  },
  rules: [
    [
      /^my-rule-(\d+)$/,
      ([, d]) => ({
        margin: `${d / 4}rem`,
      }),
    ],
  ],
  variants: [
    (matcher) => {
      if (!matcher.startsWith('hover:')) return matcher
      return {
        matcher: matcher.slice(6),
        selector: (s) => `${s}:hover`,
      }
    },
  ],
})
```

**Scoped Styles:** Use `<style scoped>` in Markdown for slide-specific CSS. This is useful for isolated styling that doesn't affect other slides.

### Fonts and Typography

Configure fonts via the `fonts` headmatter option. Slidev automatically imports from Google Fonts by default.

```yaml
---
fonts:
  sans: 'Open Sans'
  serif: 'Georgia'
  mono: 'JetBrains Mono'
  weights: '300,400,700' # Specify weights
  italic: true # Include italics
  local: 'My Local Font' # Mark as local
  fallbacks: false # Disable default fallbacks
  provider: coollabs # Use a different provider
---
```

For fine-grained control or local fonts, use `@font-face` in custom styles (`styles/index.css`). You can also inject font links directly into `index.html`.

### Assets and Backgrounds

Place static assets in the `public/` directory and reference with absolute paths (`/image.png`). Use the `background` frontmatter option for slide backgrounds.

```yaml
---
background: /images/slide-bg.jpg
---
```

For dynamic backgrounds or more complex asset handling, use Vue components and bind the `src` attribute to data or computed properties. Use the `vite-plugin-remote-assets` for bundling remote assets.

## 3. Creating Engaging and Interactive Content

Leverage Slidev's features for animations, interactivity, and rich content types.

### Advanced Animations

**Click Animations:** Control element visibility step-by-step.

- `<v-click>` / `v-click`: Reveal on next click.
- `v-after`: Reveal with the previous `v-click`.
- `.hide`: Hide instead of show (`v-click.hide`).
- `<v-clicks>`: Apply `v-click` to children (great for lists).
- `at`: Control click timing (`v-click="3"` for absolute click 3, `v-click="'+2'"` for 2 clicks after the previous relative element).
- Enter/Leave ranges: `v-click="[2, 5]"` (visible from click 2 up to, but not including, 5).
- Custom transitions for clicked elements using CSS classes `.slidev-vclick-target` and `.slidev-vclick-hidden`. Override default opacity transition with CSS.

**Motion:** Use `v-motion` directive for element transitions powered by `@vueuse/motion`. Trigger with clicks using `:click-N` variants. Combine with `v-click` for complex animation sequences.

```html
<div v-motion :initial="{ x: -100 }" :enter="{ x: 0 }" :click-1="{ y: 50 }" :click-2-4="{ opacity: 0.5 }">
  Animated Element
</div>
```

**Slide Transitions:** Apply transitions between slides using the `transition` frontmatter option. Customize with CSS transitions using Vue's transition classes (`.my-transition-enter-active`, etc.). Use navigation direction variants (`.slidev-nav-go-forward`, `forward:`, `backward:`) for direction-specific effects. Explore the experimental View Transitions API (`transition: view-transition`).

### Interactive Code Blocks

Slidev's code block features are powerful for technical talks.

- **Line Highlighting:** `{2,4-6}` highlights lines 2 and 4 through 6. Use `|` for dynamic highlighting with clicks (`{1|3|all}`).
- **Monaco Editor:** `{monaco}` turns a code block into a live editor. Configure editor options globally in `./setup/monaco.ts` or per-block with `{editorOptions: {...}}`. `{monaco-diff}` creates a diff view (`~~~` separates original/modified).
- **Monaco Runner:** `{monaco-run}` adds a run button to execute code (JS/TS by default). Configure custom runners for other languages in `./setup/code-runners.ts`. Use `{autorun:false}` to disable automatic execution. Use `{showOutputAt:'+1'}` to control output visibility with clicks.
- **Writable Monaco Editor:** `<<< @/path/to/file {monaco-write}` links the editor to a file for live editing and saving (use with caution and backups!).
- **TwoSlash:** `ts twoslash` renders TypeScript code with type info on hover or inlined. Useful for explaining types and code behavior.
- **Import Snippets:** `<<< @/path/to/snippet.js#region-name {lines:true}` imports code from files. Use `@` for project root. Combine with line highlighting and Monaco features.

### Rich Content Types

- **LaTeX:** `$inline$` and `$$block$$` for mathematical formulas (powered by KaTeX). Configure KaTeX options in `./setup/katex.ts`. Enable chemical equations by importing `katex/contrib/mhchem` in `vite.config.ts`.
- **Diagrams:** `mermaid` and `plantuml` code blocks for generating diagrams from text. Configure PlantUML server URL in headmatter.
- **Icons:** Use `<collection-name>-<icon-name>` syntax after installing `@iconify-json/*` packages. Style with CSS classes. Explore [Icônes](https://icones.js.org/) for available collections.
- **MDC Syntax:** Enable with `mdc: true` in frontmatter for enhanced Markdown with components and styles (`:inline-component{prop="value"}`, `::block-component{prop="value"}::`). Useful for applying styles or using components inline within markdown text.
- **Built-in Components:** Utilize components like `<Toc>` for table of contents, `<Tweet>` for embedding tweets, `<Youtube>` and `<SlidevVideo>` for videos, `<LightOrDark>` for theme-specific content, `<RenderWhen>` for context-specific rendering, `<Link>` for internal navigation, `<Transform>` for scaling elements, etc. Explore the [Built-in Components](https://sli.dev/builtin/components) documentation for full details and props.

## 4. Advanced Customization and Extensibility

Go beyond basic configuration by customizing the Slidev application and adding custom features.

### Directory Structure for Customization

Organize custom code in specific directories:

- `components/`: Custom Vue components (auto-imported).
- `layouts/`: Custom Vue layouts.
- `public/`: Static assets (served at `/`).
- `styles/`: Global CSS/JS styles (`index.css` or `styles/index.ts`).
- `setup/`: Custom setup files for advanced configurations:
  - `main.ts`: Extend Vue application.
  - `vite-plugins.ts`: Add custom Vite plugins based on slide data.
  - `shiki.ts`: Configure Shiki highlighter.
  - `routes.ts`: Add custom pages/routes.
  - `katex.ts`: Configure KaTeX.
  - `monaco.ts`: Configure Monaco Editor.
  - `shortcuts.ts`: Configure keyboard shortcuts.
  - `transformers.ts`: Define custom markdown transformers.
  - `code-runners.ts`: Define custom code runners for Monaco.
- `snippets/`: Code snippets for importing.
- `index.html`: Inject content into the main HTML file (`<head>` and `<body>` injections).
- `vite.config.ts`: Extend Vite configuration (merged with Slidev's config).

### Configuring the Application

- **Vite:** Extend Vite config in `vite.config.ts`. Configure internal plugins via `slidev` field. Add custom plugins based on slide data in `./setup/vite-plugins.ts` using `defineVitePluginsSetup`.
- **Vue App:** Extend the Vue application instance in `./setup/main.ts` using `defineAppSetup` to add plugins, global components, or perform initializations.
- **Routes:** Add custom pages to the presentation build by configuring routes in `./setup/routes.ts` using `defineRoutesSetup`. Useful for adding landing pages, appendixes, or interactive demos outside the main slide flow.

### Extending Functionality with Addons

Addons are npm packages (`slidev-addon-*`) that extend Slidev's features. Use them via the `addons` headmatter option. Explore the [Addon Gallery](https://sli.dev/resources/addon-gallery). Write your own addons using the same directory structure and setup files as a Slidev project to share reusable components, layouts, or configurations.

## 5. Building and Hosting High-Quality Outputs

Prepare your presentation for sharing and deployment.

### Building as a SPA

Build your slides into a static SPA using `slidev build`. Configure the base path (`--base`) for subpath deployment and output directory (`--out`). Build multiple decks at once by providing multiple markdown files.

### Exporting to Various Formats

Export to PDF, PPTX, PNG, or Markdown using `slidev export`. Install `playwright-chromium`. Use options like `--with-clicks` to export each click step, `--range` to export specific slides, `--dark` for dark mode export, `--timeout` and `--wait` for handling complex slides, `--executable-path` for specifying a browser executable, `--with-toc` for PDF outline, and `--omit-background` for transparent PNGs. Troubleshoot missing content (increase `--wait`) or broken emojis (install fonts).

**Browser Exporter:** Use the built-in UI at `/export` for interactive exporting with a live preview.

### Hosting

Deploy the built SPA (`dist` folder) to static hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Configuration files (`netlify.toml`, `vercel.json`, GitHub Actions workflow) are often included in starter templates. Host on Docker using provided images or by building your own Dockerfile.
