### Roles

Role-specific instructions and responsibilities.

- [`product-manager`]clinerules/product-manager.md): Defines Cline's role as an experienced product manager for
  project planning and documentation. `['product-management', 'documentation', 'user-needs', 'role']`

### Processes

Specific processes, templates, or formats for various tasks.

- [`create-prd`]clinerules/create-prd.md): Outlines the process for generating Product Requirements Documents
  (PRDs). `['prd', 'requirements', 'documentation', 'workflow']`
- [`commit-message-format`]clinerules/commit-message-format.md): Provides a standardized format for commit messages
  following conventional commits standard. `['git', 'commits', 'documentation', 'workflow']`

### Meta

Guidelines about rule creation, maintenance, and knowledge management.

- [`clinerules-best-practices`]clinerules/clinerules-best-practices.md): Offers guidance on writing effective
  `.clinerules` for clarity, structure, and actionable content.
  `['meta', 'guideline', 'clinerules', 'documentation', 'best-practices']`
- [`clinerules-index`]clinerules/clinerules-index.md): A unified index for cross-referencing and understanding
  interactions between different `.clinerules` files. `['index', 'cross-reference', 'clinerules-overview']`

### Website Development Guides

Guides specific to web development across different frameworks.

- [`web-design-bank`]clinerules/web-design-bank.md): Resource for web design principles and practices, maintaining
  a consistent UI/UX design system across sessions. `['web-design', 'ui', 'ux', 'resource']`

### MCP Servers

Details about installed Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that extend Cline's capabilities with additional tools and
resources.

- **Sequential Thinking (`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking`)**: Provides the
  'sequentialthinking' tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving. This tool aids in breaking down complex problems
  into iterative steps, allowing for hypothesis generation and verification. It is particularly useful for multi-step
  tasks and maintaining context over multiple interactions. `['mcp', 'sequential-thinking', 'problem-solving']`
- **Context7 (`github.com/upstash/context7-mcp`)**: Offers tools like 'resolve-library-id' and 'get-library-docs' for
  accessing up-to-date documentation and library information. This server is essential for retrieving
  Context7-compatible library IDs and detailed documentation, enhancing research and integration capabilities.

## Memory Bank Integration

### Key Commands

- **initialize memory bank**: Use when starting a new project

  ```bash
  # Creates initial Memory Bank structure
  # Generates base documentation files
  # Sets up version tracking
  ```

- **follow your custom instructions**: Read Memory Bank files and continue work

  ```bash
  # Loads all Memory Bank files
  # Understands current context
  # Maintains continuity
  ```

- **update memory bank**: Trigger full documentation review

  ```bash
  # Reviews all files
  # Updates documentation
  # Synchronizes information
  ```

### Mode Selection

- **PLAN MODE**: Information gathering and solution architecture

  - Review documentation
  - Ask questions
  - Create detailed plans
  - Get user approval

- **ACT MODE**: Implementation and execution
  - Execute planned changes
  - Update documentation
  - Verify results
  - Track progress

## Usage Examples

1. Starting a New Project:

   ```bash
   User: initialize memory bank
   Cline: *Creates Memory Bank structure*
   User: *Provides project requirements*
   Cline: *Sets up initial documentation*
   ```

2. Continuing Work:

   ```bash
   User: follow your custom instructions
   Cline: *Reads Memory Bank*
   User: *Provides task*
   Cline: *Continues with context*
   ```

3. Updating Documentation:

   ```bash
   User: update memory bank
   Cline: *Reviews all files*
   Cline: *Updates documentation*
   User: *Verifies changes*
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Incomplete context loading

   - Solution: Use "follow your custom instructions"
   - Verify Memory Bank files exist

2. Mode confusion

   - Solution: Explicitly state needed mode
   - Check current mode in environment details

3. Documentation sync issues
   - Solution: Use "update memory bank"
   - Verify file modifications

### Best Practices

1. Regular Memory Bank updates
2. Clear mode transitions
3. Explicit command usage
4. Version control integration
5. Regular validation checks
